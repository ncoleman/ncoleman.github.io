      <title>A Good Day Out</title>

      <description>Every Sunday, the BMW Motorcycle Club of WA meets for morning coffee at Catalano&amp;rsquo;s cafe in Vic Park to talk about motorcycles and life. Around 8:30am, a group will form up behind the leader and head out for a nice ride to lunch in the countryside, doing a few hundred kilometres and away for several hours. It&amp;rsquo;s almost always a top ride and today was no exception.
Up to Lesmurdie and through the hills then down to the plain and a stint on the freeway to Kwinana then Rockingham.</description>

      <title>Blog Setup Not Complete</title>

      <description>Setup is not complete, it turns out. I had been using the preview server to view my changes and everything looked fine as in my last post. But when I went to deploy the content over to the live server, I could not get the deployment to work. Most of the styling was missing and the site looked like a terribly brutal minimalist site.
I spent an entire afternoon working on it with Github, Gitlab and Netlify, but with no success.</description>

      <title>Blog Setup Complete</title>

      <description>The blog setup using zola is pretty much complete. The only thing left is a commenting system, but in the meantime, while I&amp;rsquo;m sorting that out, readers can get in touch via Contact Me.
After that there is just some tidying up and aesthetic niceties. I would like to get the About and the Contact Me pages off the front page &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re accessible from the menu bar at the top anyway.</description>

      <description>My second post, to test length formatting, mixing markdown and HTML, and the summary.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc eu feugiat sapien. Aenean ligula nunc, laoreet id sem in, interdum bibendum felis. Donec vel dui neque. Praesent ac sem ut justo volutpat rutrum a imperdiet tellus. Nam lobortis massa non hendrerit hendrerit. Vivamus porttitor dignissim turpis, eget aliquam urna tincidunt non. Aliquam et fringilla turpis. Nullam eros est, eleifend in ornare sed, hendrerit eget est.</description>

      <title>Starting Out</title>

      <description>This is a new blog using the Hugo static website generator. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Go, which I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but it seems pretty easy to use without having to know the ins-and-outs of Go.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go (&amp;lt;ahem&amp;gt;).
Test highlighting with some code examples:
Bash if i &amp;lt; 10; then i = 10 fi Looks good. Had to change the markdown from two tabs to eight spaces for i = 10 though, otherwise the indentation wasn&amp;rsquo;t recognised.</description>
