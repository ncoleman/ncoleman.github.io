If you are using Linux and the pm-utils suite from freedesktop.org to manage resume/suspend, and the chances are you are since most distros use it, then you could benefit from reading a recent post on my other blog [1].
Pm-utils’ implementation on CPU governor and CPU frequency is broken. If you use the userspace governor with a custom frequency, the frequency does not get restored on resume.</description>

![status bar temperature][/img/status_bar_temp.jpg]
Hot, hot, hot. The weather has been unbelievably hot for the last few days, with the same forecast for the next week.
Above is a screenshot from part of my status bar, showing 42°C (107°F), on Australia Day, 26th January 2012, at 3:00pm.
It shows the current temperature, “feels like” temperature, humidity, and wind direction and speed with gusts.</description>

I went to install Wireshark this morning and realised why I hadn’t bothered before. The source code is 20MB [^footnote]. God knows how long that will take to compile, especially since it seems to use autoconf and generates complex, multi-nested Makefiles many levels deep.
I already had tcpdump installed, so I used that instead.</description>

I have been looking for a command-line programmers’ calculator for a while. I needed it to do the usual things like base number conversion, bit shifting and masking, and so on.
I searched for quite a while and couldn’t find anything. Almost all were GUI, which I didn’t want, or were some ridiculous price, which I couldn’t justify being a programmer myself.</description>

Interesting discussion on Hacker News about an interview with Bill Joy, creator of Vi.
Joy mentions that one of the most important use cases was that, in those days, everyone had only a 300 baud connection to the host. That meant the editor had to be efficient in screen repaints while interacting with commands from the user.</description>

With India playing Australia at Sydney right now, and captain Michael Clarke on 325, I thought it would be interesting to look at the top ten Australian scores of all time (which Channel Nine has conveniently provided for us viewers). Matthew Hayden is highest at 380, then Don Bradman at 334 (Leeds in 1930).</description>
