      <description>This is a lost post from my early blogs around 2012, rediscovered and posted here in mid-2020
I went to install Wireshark this morning and realised why I hadn’t bothered before. The source code is 20MB [^footnote]. God knows how long that will take to compile, especially since it seems to use autoconf and generates complex, multi-nested Makefiles many levels deep.
I already had tcpdump installed, so I used that instead.</description>
