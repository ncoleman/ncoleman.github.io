      <description>The only thing left with the blog was to add a commenting system. Hugo&amp;rsquo;s default is Disqus, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want that for the usual reasons of lack-of-privacy and bloat. After searching around, I looked at isso and commento.
Commento needs Postgres whereas isso uses the much lighter SQLite. Since I get only a few comments, it&amp;rsquo;s isso first up.
The first obstacle is that the pip install succeeds, but isso run fails immediately with</description>

      <title>Blog Setup Not Complete</title>

      <description>Setup is not complete, it turns out. I had been using the preview server to view my changes and everything looked fine as in my last post. But when I went to deploy the content over to the live server, I could not get the deployment to work. Most of the styling was missing and the site looked like a brutal minimalist site[1].
I spent an entire afternoon working on it with Github, Gitlab and Netlify, but with no success.</description>

      <description>I switched to the zola static site generator from hugo. Hugo&amp;rsquo;s theming seems complex and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a theme I liked, whereas I found one with zola almost immediately.
The blog setup using zola is pretty much complete. I&amp;rsquo;ve done an About, Contact Me and Search pages. The only thing left to do is a commenting system, but in the meantime, while I&amp;rsquo;m sorting that out, readers can get in touch via Contact Me.</description>

      <title>Starting Out</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started blogging after a six year break.
This is a new blog using the Hugo static website generator written in Go. It&amp;rsquo;s super fast at creating the site, less than 1 second.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go &amp;lt;ahem&amp;gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s some dummy content to test things out.
Test highlighting with some code examples:
Bash if i &amp;lt; 10; then i = 10 fi Looks good apart from the closing fi. I had to change the markdown from two tabs to eight spaces for i = 10 though, otherwise the indentation wasn&amp;rsquo;t recognised as markdown.</description>
