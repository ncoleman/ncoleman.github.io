      <description>Every Sunday, the BMW Motorcycle Club of WA meets for morning coffee at Catalano&amp;rsquo;s cafe in Vic Park to talk about motorcycles and life. Around 8:30am, a group will form up behind the leader and head out for a nice ride to lunch in the countryside, doing a few hundred kilometres and away for several hours. It&amp;rsquo;s almost always a top ride and today was no exception.
Up to Lesmurdie and through the hills then down to the plain and a stint on the freeway to Kwinana then Rockingham.</description>
